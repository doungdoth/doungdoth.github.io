## USB Booting Issues?

#### Did you have an issue come up when your PC did not want to boot external flash drive USB even after going to Bios and selecting appropriate device? Did an Error message popped up saying something along the lines of "device is not found"? So what do you do?


#### After you install what ever that it is you want on your external flash drive USB you may find out that you are finding some trouble getting it to work. Now there are some ways to go about this.


#### Usually something needs to be configured in the BIOS of your computer. That means tweaking a few settings to allow the external flash drive USB to be recognized and run. Once this is complete, your external hard drive USB device should now be able to run and work.


#### One of the reasons why your are running into this problem is that, some modern computers boot immediately from the internal hard drive or SSD, paying no attention to any external bootable media first. 


#### Also some modern computers use  UEFI motherboards instead of the old-fashioned BIOS.  Depending on the operating system, it may not   support UEFI  and supports BIOS. UEFI motherboards support what is called legacy boot, which allows the computer to boot external devices.


####  Press the power button, press the key F12 until the boot menu comes up. If that does not work, you may need to enter the BIOS and change it to allow the boot menue to show. 


#### Using the F1 Key to enter the BIOS, you wan to look for anything regarding UEFI/Legacy Boot. 



#### Once you find that, change the settings to enable or on. If theres and option for both, set that as well. 


#### Then after you do that you have to set the priority. Change or enable the settings to Legacy first. To allow the  external flash drive to first boot.




#### Here are a few links to help you out. One is a website that explains step by step on how to get it to work. The other, is a video on YouTube if you'd rather watch.


#### * If you are still having issues, try searching the make and model of your computer and possibly operating system and search USB booting
